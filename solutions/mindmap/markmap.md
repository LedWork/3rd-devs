- Importance of token management in AI
- Value of multimodality in enhancing AI capabilities

## Token Limits in AI Models
### Input/Output Constraints
- Token processing limits in current state-of-the-art models
- Google DeepMind's advancements: "Leave no Context Behind"

### Context Windows
- The concept of infinite context windows vs. practical implementations
- Competitive models struggling with token limits (100-200k tokens)
- Solutions such as prompt caching to enhance processing efficiency

### Output Token Limits
- Challenges encountered in document transformations (e.g., editing, translation)
- The necessity for content chunking to enable efficient processing

## Understanding Document Structure
### Document Definition
- Composition of main content and metadata
- Relevance in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks

### Metadata Importance
- Source identification and provision of context
- Strategies for data filtering and content compression

## Document Generation Techniques
### Splitting Techniques
- Text splitting approaches to maintain context 
- Recursive and overlap methods for better context retention

### Examples
- Illustrated challenges in context retention with literary texts
- Practical case studies showcasing effective splitting techniques

## Retrieval Processes
### Conventional RAG Approach
- Document creation, indexing, and contextual challenges
- Risks of context loss in hybrid searching

### Contextual Retrieval Method
- Enhancing context through document processing via LLMs 
- Effective cost management through caching strategies

## Working with Unstructured Data
### Techniques and Applications
- Multimodal transformation strategies for unstructured data sources
